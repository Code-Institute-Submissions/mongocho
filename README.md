## Mongocho

## (de)MOtivational Cartoons

As an anthusiastic cartoonist and illustrator, I planned and built a website to showcase some of my work, to have fun and to connect with an audience that will appreciate my humor and will hopefully engage with what it has in it.

The website is not intended to be an exhaustive portfolio of my work but a creative excercise to show a limited number of drawings and cartoons in the gallery which I am planning to update regularly.

I wanted to have a memory game where I show some of my characters in pairs to be matched in the least possible number of moves. 

The logo has been created by me.

## UX

This website has been designed as a multi-page front end website with parallax on scrolling.

The website shows at first the logo and a tagline, nav bar and sample of the drawings on parallax.
There is a section with a short introduction to what MOngocho is about and a footer with subscribe section and social media links.

There are several hover effects in the footer, over the titles and in social media icons.

The Contact Us section is a form with "required fields" and drop down menu to select style of painting desired.

### Using the website

- The visitor will see the Landing Page with the logo on top and a tagline.
- A NavBar provides an easy way to select the desired section and sticks to the top when scrolling down.
- A first cartoon appears and gives a 3D effect (Parallax) when scrolling) giving way to text explaining who I am.
- A new cartoon appears and, again, a text section appears with an explanation of how I create my drawings.
- A third cartoon is revealed before reaching the footer.

### The Gallery

- The next page is a gallery with a selection of cartoons and drawings. This gallery displays in a modal with easy navigation in carrousel or in group with easy browsing.

### The Memory Game

- The memory game is a 4 x 4 card grid with back logo and 8 pair of cartoons (4 Female and 4 Male).
- I have modified the game I got inspiration and guidance from with new styling, design, number of cards and functionality.
- I added a Restart Button and a counter to make it more engaging and fun to play.

# Technologies Used

## The project was build with:

- HTML, to structure the website
- CSS, to style the website
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), for gallery
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), for the development environment
- [Github](https://github.com/), as the version control technology and GitHub Pages as the webserver technology to publish the website
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), to utilize responsive elements
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), to utilize icons
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), to utilize different fonts

## Testing

- Manual testing was performed throughout the creation of this site. 
- No testing has been automated. 
- We have asked 8 people to act as potential users of the website.
- The site has been tested in Laptops and desktops in in Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE to ensure it displays as desired.
- The site has been tested in iOS and Android phones in Safari, Chrome and Firefox.
- Throughout the build of this site, I used Chrome Develpers Tool.

- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [CSS Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)



In all screens tested the website looks exactly in the desired way and responded to an imaginary user/gallery owner trying to achieve different goals in the site.

### Bugs

There was a bug when displaying the memory card in small screen. The cards animation did not work and the functionality of the game was not responding.

The problem is now fixed.
The css transform property is not fully supported by IOS browsers, to fully support it, I needed to add some css browser specific prefix to make it work on iOS (-webkit-transform:) . What I did was to copy the css file into https://autoprefixer.github.io/ to help format it and add the necessary css prefixes so it can be supported by most browsers.
now is working very well.

There was a bug on displaying the parallax background images in landscape, as they were rendered out of proportion
The parallax effect on mobile is not fully supported. The media query uses 600px to stop the parallax effect but when switched to landscape, the width becomes larger and the parallax effect tried to render in the mobile browser so I increased the width of the media query to 1200px to cover most phones and tabs. The parallax effects works fine on android even at the 600px.

## Deployment

I used Visual Studio Code to write all the code. My website is deployed on Github Pages - To visit, click [Here](https://fabibrachetta.github.io/mongocho/)

- In VSCode , select File -> Add Folder to Workspace -> Select the newly created directory
- Select Terminal Window
- In the window, type: git config --global user.name <github userID>
- In VSCode, I’ve created the site, committed and pushed onto repository.
- On GitHub, I’ve clicked on Mongocho repository.
- Under MOngocho repository name, click “Settings”.
- Under "GitHub Pages", use the Source drop-down menu and select Master Branch for live url.
